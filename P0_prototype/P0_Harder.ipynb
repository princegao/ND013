    "# **Finding Lane Lines on the Road** \n",
    "***\n",
    "In this project, you will use the tools you learned about in the lesson to identify lane lines on the road.  You can develop your pipeline on a single image, and later apply the result to a video stream (really just a series of images). Check out the video clip \"P0_example1.mp4\" (also contained in this repository) to see what the output should look like. \n",

    "\n",
    "**Note:** you can zoom in and explore the image within the interactive matplotlib window.  If, at any point, you encounter frozen display windows or other confounding issues, you can always start again with a clean slate by going to the \"Kernel\" menu above and selecting \"Restart & Clear Output\".\n",
